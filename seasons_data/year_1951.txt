5th season of FIA's Formula One motor racing




1951 Formula One season
Drivers' Champion: Juan Manuel Fangio

Races by countryRaces by venue
Juan Manuel Fangio driving for Alfa Romeo won the 1951 World Championship of Drivers.
The 1951 Formula One season was the fifth season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the second World Championship of Drivers, which was contested over eight races between 27 May and 28 October 1951. The season also included several non-championship races for Formula One cars.
Juan Manuel Fangio won his first Drivers' Championship,[1] beating reigning champion and Alfa Romeo teammate Nino Farina, as well as several drivers from their main rival, Ferrari. Alfa Romeo has not won any Formula One championship since.
Multiple teams, including Alfa Romeo, were running chassis from before World War II. Regulation changes for 1952, however, would make them obsolete.

^ Pietsch was also entered in the No. 80 Maserati. He only participated with the Maserati in practice and qualified and raced in the No. 78 Alfa Romeo.[2]

^ Behra secretly replaced the unwell Trintignant for the race of the Italian Grand Prix. Team principal Amédée Gordini did not inform the race organizers about this change as it would have reduced the starting fee the team received. Behra even wore his compatriot’s helmet to disguise the switch.[3][4]


Team and driver changes[edit]
HWM made their debut with the 51, driven by future champion Stirling Moss.
Alfa Romeo replaced their full-time driver Luigi Fagioli with Consalvo Sanesi, who had joined the team at the end of 1950. Toulo de Graffenried also drove three races for the team, his only Grands Prix for a works team.
Ferrari hired Piero Taruffi, who had made his F1 debut with Alfa Romeo at the end of last season, and José Froilán González, coming from a private Maserati team.
Gordini waited until the fourth race in the calendar to compete. They added André Simon to their line-up.
Talbot-Lago did not enter their works team for 1951. Three of their drivers decided to each take over a Talbot chassis and race it under their own name.
Maserati, likewise, did not enter their works team. Driver Louis Chiron moved to Louis Rosier's private Talbot team, while Franco Rol would return later in 1951 with O.S.C.A..
HWM made their debut with drivers George Abecassis and future champion Stirling Moss. They would only enter the season opener, before returning in 1952.
Mid-season changes[edit]
Alfa Romeo driver Luigi Fagioli in his last race, the 1951 French Grand Prix
Future champions BRM made their debut in the British Grand Prix with Peter Walker and Reg Parnell. It would be their only start, before returning in 1954.
Luigi Fagioli made his return with Alfa Romeo in the French Grand Prix, in which the team manager ordered him to hand over his car to teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. Fagioli was allegedly so disappointed that he chose to retire from the sport immediately. Felice Bonetto replaced him as Alfa Romeo's third driver, while Consalvo Sanesi left the team.

Calendar changes[edit]
The Monaco Grand Prix was dropped from the calendar due to budgetary concerns and a lack of regulations in the sport.[6]
The Swiss Grand Prix was moved from June to May to become the season opener.
The British Grand Prix was moved back from May to July.
For the first time, the German and Spanish Grand Prix featured on the calendar as championship rounds.
World Championship season summary[edit]
Argentinian Juan Manuel Fangio won the first of his five World Championships in 1951 driving for Alfa Romeo
Alfa Romeo won four of the eight World Championship races in 1951 with the Type 159
Ferrari's newer, naturally aspirated 4.5-litre cars offered a real challenge to the Alfas, which were nearing the end of their development potential. The Ferraris were able to capitalize on the inefficiency of the Alfa's very thirsty engines, particularly at Silverstone. Although Alfas won four races, with Fangio taking the championship, Ferrari's three victories spelled the end for the Alfas. BRM made their only championship appearance with the V16 at Silverstone, and the old, slow Talbots were increasingly outclassed.
Points were given to the top 5 finishers (8, 6, 4, 3, 2). One point was given for the fastest lap. Only the best four of eight scores counted towards the world championship. Points for shared drives were divided equally between the drivers, regardless of who had driven more laps.

Pre-season non-championship races[edit]
Although the official championship season would start in late May in Switzerland, a handful of non-championship events were to be run. The first was the first-ever Syracuse Grand Prix near the ancient city of Syracuse on the southern island of Sicily. This race was won by Italian Luigi Villoresi driving the new 4 1/2 litre Ferrari 375 on the 3.4 miles (5.5 km) public road circuit. Villoresi would triumph again two weeks later at Pau in southwest France over homeland hero Louis Rosier and Nino Farina, driving a Maserati for this race. On the same day, Thai driver Birabongse Bhanudej would triumph at the Richmond Trophy race at Goodwood in southern England in his Maserati. 
Three weeks after the Goodwood and Pau races, it was the San Remo Grand Prix in western Italy, not far from Monaco. Alberto Ascari made his first appearance of the season and promptly won in a Ferrari 375 on this twisty and demanding 2.1 miles (3.4 km) street circuit, ahead of his countryman Dorino Serafini and Swiss Rudi Fischer, both in Ferraris. A week later was the Bordeaux Grand Prix in western France, and it was won by Rosier in a Talbot, ahead of Fischer and Briton Peter Whitehead in a Ferrari. Besides Farina, this race did not feature any Italians because they were competing in the Mille Miglia.
A week later was the BRDC International Trophy race at Silverstone, with the Alfa Romeos making their first appearance in 1951. Of the first two heats, Fangio won the first while Farina won the second, and Reg Parnell won the final all-important event, which was stopped because of torrential rain and flooding. Two weeks after this was the Paris Grand Prix in the Bois de Boulogne Park in the French capital city, which Farina won in a Maserati.

Race 1: Switzerland[edit]
Main article: 1951 Swiss Grand Prix
A week after the BRDC International Trophy race, the Formula One Championship season started in Switzerland at the very dangerous and tree-lined Bremgarten public road circuit near Bern around the time the Monaco Grand Prix would have been held, but that historic race was not held this year. Alfa Romeo, the dominant team in 1950 with its supercharged 159 Alfetta, took the first five places on the grid, except 3rd, which Luigi Villoresi took in a Ferrari. Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio was on pole position, with his Italian teammate Giuseppe "Nino" Farina alongside him. The race started while it was raining, and with its overhanging trees lining the road, this circuit was even more dangerous in the wet. But Fangio made no mistake and won the race from Piero Taruffi in a Ferrari and Farina, whose decision to run the race without changing tires proved wrong.

Race 2: Indianapolis 500[edit]
Main article: 1951 Indianapolis 500
The Indianapolis 500 in the United States was run three days after the Swiss Grand Prix on a Wednesday. It was the only non-European championship round and the only round that was not run to FIA Grand Prix regulations. Lee Wallard won this demanding race in his Kurtis Kraft-Offenhauser.

Race 3: Belgium[edit]
Main article: 1951 Belgian Grand Prix
Farina had won again at Ulster Trophy held at the very dangerous and fast Dundrod circuit in Northern Ireland in an Alfa, and the next championship Grand Prix was in Belgium at the fastest circuit of the year: the spectacular and rural 8.7 miles (14.0 km) Spa-Francorchamps circuit. With Fangio and Farina once again 1–2 with the Ferraris of Villoresi and Alberto Ascari taking 3rd and 4th, the Alfas and Ferraris dueled around this circuit, with only 13 entries – small grids in all kinds of motorsports in Europe were commonplace at Spa, because of the fear most drivers had of the circuit. Farina, already on a high after winning at Dundrod, won by three minutes over Ascari and Villoresi, with Fangio finishing four laps down in 9th after one of his Alfa's wheels jammed on its hub.

Race 4: France[edit]
Main article: 1951 French Grand Prix
The French Grand Prix, given the honorary designation of the European Grand Prix this year, was held at the very fast 4.8 miles (7.7 km) Reims-Gueux circuit (a circuit only two mph slower than Spa) deep in northern French champagne country played the host for an exciting race. Fangio, on pole again, was beaten off the line by 3rd-placed qualifier Ascari, with 2nd-placed qualifier Farina making a terrible start and dropping to 11th. On this triangular public road circuit, made up entirely of long straights, slight kinks, and slow, angular corners saw Ascari retire his car with a broken gearbox and Fangio nursing a sick car. Farina pushed very hard and eventually took the lead. Argentine José Froilán González was 2nd in a Ferrari, and 53-year old pre-war great Luigi Fagioli in an Alfa was 3rd in a one-off appearance this year. González was chasing Farina very hard, but Farina's car developed magneto problems and had to fall back, which put González in the lead, with Fagioli in 2nd. However, during both the leader's pitstops, as was commonplace in Grand Prix racing up until 1957, when it was banned – González handed his car over to Ascari, and Fagioli exchanged his healthy car with Fangio's mechanically unhealthy car, so Ascari and Fangio were back in 1st and 2nd where they had been before. But Fangio took advantage of Ascari's brake problems on his Ferrari (the Reims-Gueux circuit was very hard on engines and brakes) to win a race that holds the record for farthest racing distance ever completed for a Grand Prix, 373 miles (600 km). Fagioli, finishing 22 laps down and furious over having to swap cars with Fangio, quit Grand Prix racing on the spot. The veteran Italian would die after crashing a Lancia during a sportscar race at Monaco in 1952.

Race 5: Britain[edit]
Main article: 1951 British Grand Prix
The British Grand Prix at the Silverstone airfield circuit in England played host to round 5 of the World Championship, and this race was to make history. The Alfa Romeos, with their powerful 420 hp supercharged 1.5L engines were fast but had horrendous fuel consumption: 1.5 miles per gallon (thanks to the relatively simple pre-World War II engine design), meaning that Fangio and Farina had to stop twice to refuel, José Froilán González in the more fuel-efficient 4.5L naturally aspirated V12 Ferrari went on to win, with Fangio second. This was the first time Enzo Ferrari had won a Grand Prix with a car of his own company's construction, and this team went on to be the most successful in Formula One history.

Race 6: Germany[edit]
Main article: 1951 German Grand Prix
A week after the British Grand Prix, the non-championship Dutch Grand Prix at the fast beachside Zandvoort circuit near Amsterdam was won by Louis Rosier in a Talbot, ahead of veteran Phillippe Etancelin and up-and-comer Stirling Moss in an HWM.
West Germany had been banned from international sports competitions until 1951, so the German Grand Prix was able to be a Grand Prix championship round for the first time since 1939. The venue was the same as it had been in 1939 – it was the dauntingly challenging, dangerous, and twisty 14.2 miles (22.9 km) Nürburgring Nordschleife. Ascari took pole position in front of his teammate González and Alfa drivers Fangio and Farina. At the start, Farina took the lead, but the Alfas started to develop overheating problems, and Farina soon retired. In addition to engine problems, the gearbox in Fangio's Alfa lost 1st and 2nd of four gears. After trading the lead with Fangio during pitstops, Ascari took the lead and won his first championship Formula One Grand Prix.

Race 7: Italy[edit]
Main article: 1951 Italian Grand Prix
A week after the German Grand Prix was the Albi Grand Prix on a high-speed and dangerous public road circuit outside the southwestern French village of Albi. Maurice Trintignant won this race in a Simca. Ten days after this race, the Coppa Acerbo at the 15.8 miles (25.4 km) and dauntingly dangerous Pescara Circuit in eastern Italy, which was won by José Froilán González in a Ferrari. Two weeks later, Fangio won the Bari Grand Prix in the small southeastern Italian coastal city. 
Italy was the next championship race, and the Monza Autodrome near Milan played host to the seventh round of the Formula One Grand Prix championship. Fangio, in an Alfa, pole position again, but he retired his car, which had engine problems; Farina, who had taken Felice Bonetto's Alfa, had a leaking fuel tank and had to come in twice for fuel, which dropped him down the order far enough for him only to get as far as third. Fellow local hero and Milan native Ascari won again in his Ferrari–which kept his championship hopes alive to catch the leader Fangio going into the last championship Grand Prix in Spain.

Race 8: Spain[edit]
Main article: 1951 Spanish Grand Prix
The last non-championship race of the year, the Goodwood Trophy, was won by Farina in an Alfa three weeks after the Italian Grand Prix.
The first ever Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, held at the Pedralbes street circuit in Barcelona, took place four weeks after the Goodwood Trophy race. The Ferrari and Alfa Romeo teams each ran four cars, with Ferrari fielding Ascari, Gigi Villoresi, Froilan González, and Piero Taruffi and Alfa Romeo running Fangio, Giuseppe Farina, Felice Bonetto, and Baron Emanuel de Graffenried. Ascari was fastest in practice and shared the front row of the 4–3–4 grid with Fangio, González, and Farina. Behind them were Villoresi, de Graffenried and Taruffi. Ascari led from the start, with González chasing, but by the end of the first lap, González had dropped to fifth behind Farina, Fangio, and Bonetto. Fangio quickly passed Farina and took the lead from Ascari on the fourth lap. As Fangio sailed away to victory, Ferrari's challenge fell apart along with its tires – the team having opted to use smaller wheels than normal. By the time the team had sorted out the problem, Ascari was two laps behind. Fangio duly won the race and his first of five championships, with González finishing second and Farina third.

World Championship of Drivers standings[edit]
Further information: List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems
Points were awarded to the top five classified finishers, with an additional point awarded for setting the fastest lap, regardless of finishing position or even classification. Only the best four results counted towards the championship. Shared drives result in half points for each driver if they finished in a points-scoring position. If more than one driver set the same fastest lap time, the fastest lap point would be divided equally between the drivers. Numbers without parentheses are championship points; numbers in parentheses are total points scored. Points were awarded in the following system:
