Motor car race
The 2021 Qatar Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Ooredoo Qatar Grand Prix 2021) was a Formula One motor race, held on 21 November 2021 at the Losail International Circuit in Qatar. The inaugural Qatar Grand Prix, it was the 20th round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship. 
Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton won the race ahead of Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, while Alpine's Fernando Alonso scored his first podium since the 2014 Hungarian Grand Prix,[4] as well as his first podium with Team Enstone since the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix.
As a result of Hamilton's victory, Losail became the 30th different circuit where he has won a Grand Prix.[5]


Background[edit]
Further information: 2021 Formula One World Championship § Calendar changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic
The Qatar Grand Prix did not feature on the original calendar, but was added in place of the Australian Grand Prix, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first Qatar Grand Prix, with a 10-year contract to host the Qatar Grand Prix from 2023 at a new purpose-built circuit;[6] there was no Qatar Grand Prix in 2022, as the country hosted the FIFA World Cup.[7][8][9]

Championship standings[edit]
Heading into the race, Max Verstappen led the World Drivers' Standings with 332.5 points, 14 points ahead of second-placed Lewis Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas was in third on 203 points, too far behind Verstappen to be able to win the title but 25 points ahead of Sergio Pérez in fourth, with Lando Norris fifth on 151 points. In the World Constructors' Standings, Mercedes led with 521.5 points, 11 points ahead of second-placed Red Bull Racing. Ferrari were third with 287.5 points ahead of McLaren on 256. Alpine and AlphaTauri were fifth and sixth with 112 points each, with Alpine being ahead courtesy of a win, compared to no wins for AlphaTauri.[10]

Entrants[edit]

Tyre choices[edit]
Sole tyre supplier Pirelli allocated the C1, C2, and C3 compounds of tyre to be used during this Grand Prix weekend.[12]

Practice[edit]

Notes

^1  – Max Verstappen received a five-place grid penalty for failing to respect a double waved yellow flag in Q3.[19]
^2  – Valtteri Bottas received a three-place grid penalty for failing to respect a single waved yellow flag in Q3.[20]
Race[edit]
The race began at 17:00 local time and was contested over 57 laps.[15] The race was noted for four front-left tyre failures, as teams attempted to run one-stop strategies against Pirelli's advice.[21][22][23] Hamilton won the race, leading every lap, but Verstappen, who finished second, denied him a grand slam by setting the fastest lap. Fernando Alonso finished third, taking his first podium since the 2014 Hungarian Grand Prix.

Notes[edit]


^ a b Nikita Mazepin is Russian, but he competed as a neutral competitor using the designation RAF (Russian Automobile Federation), as the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a ban on Russia competing at World Championships. The ban was implemented by the World Anti-Doping Agency in response to the state-sponsored doping program of Russian athletes.[16]
