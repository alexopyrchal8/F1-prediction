Motor car race
The 2022 United States Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Aramco United States Grand Prix 2022) was a Formula One motor race, held on October 23, 2022, at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, United States. The race was the 19th round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship and the 51st running of the United States Grand Prix, the 43rd time the race was run as a World Championship event since the inaugural 1950 season, and the tenth time a World Championship round was held at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.
It was won by defending champion Max Verstappen, who was followed by Lewis Hamilton in second and Charles Leclerc in third. With Verstappen taking victory and teammate Sergio Pérez finishing fourth, Red Bull secured its fifth Constructors' Championship title and the first since 2013.[3]


Background[edit]
The event was held across the weekend of October 21–23. It was the nineteenth round of the 2022 Formula One World Championship. Max Verstappen entered the race as the defending winner. 

Championship standings before the race[edit]
Going into the weekend, Max Verstappen had secured his second consecutive Drivers' Championship at the previous round, the Japanese Grand Prix. He led by 113 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, second, and Charles Leclerc, third, by 114. Red Bull Racing team led the Constructors' Championship from Ferrari by 165 points and Mercedes by 232 points.[4] Red Bull Racing could have secured their fifth World Constructors' Championship, and first since 2013, if Ferrari would not outscore them by 19 points.[5]

^1  – Charles Leclerc received a ten-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of power unit elements.[15]
^2  – Sergio Pérez, Zhou Guanyu and Fernando Alonso received a five-place grid penalty for exceeding their quota of power unit elements.[16][15] Zhou gained a position following Yuki Tsunoda's penalty.[14]
^3  – Yuki Tsunoda received a five-place grid penalty for a new gearbox driveline.[14]
^4  – Esteban Ocon qualified 17th, but he was required to start the race from the back of the grid for exceeding his quota of power unit elements. The new power unit elements were changed while the car was under parc fermé without the permission of the technical delegate. He was therefore required to start the race from the pit lane.[14]
