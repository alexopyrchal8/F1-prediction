Motor car race
The 2024 Bahrain Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Gulf Air Bahrain Grand Prix 2024) was a Formula One motor race held on 2 March 2024 at the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir, Bahrain. It was the opening round of the 2024 Formula One World Championship.
After taking pole position in qualifying, Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing led every lap, won the race, and had the fastest lap, his fifth career grand chelem. His teammate Sergio Pérez finished in second, followed by Carlos Sainz Jr. of Ferrari.


Background[edit]
The event was held across 29 February – 2 March. It was the opening round of the 2024 Formula One World Championship and the twentieth running of the Bahrain Grand Prix.[4][5] It also marked the 20th anniversary of the first Bahrain Grand Prix held in 2004.[6]
The Grand Prix began at 18:00 local time (UTC+3) on Saturday, 2 March 2024, becoming the first Formula One World Championship Grand Prix season-opener race to start on a Saturday since the 1982 South African Grand Prix. The event was held on Saturday to comply with regulations that require a minimum of one week between Grands Prix, as the following Grand Prix in Saudi Arabia was scheduled to take place on 9 March. The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was moved a day forward from Sunday to avoid a conflict with start of Ramadan, which was expected to begin on 10 March.[4]
