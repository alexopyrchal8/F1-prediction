Motor car race
The 2021 Dutch Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Heineken Dutch Grand Prix 2021) was a Formula One motor race held on 5 September 2021 at the Circuit Zandvoort. It was the thirteenth round of the 2021 Formula One World Championship and the first Dutch Grand Prix to take place since 1985.[3] The race was won by Max Verstappen – prior to him, no Dutch driver had won their home race.


Background[edit]
Circuit Zandvoort in 2018, prior to renovations.
The event, which was held over the weekend of 3–5 September at the Circuit Zandvoort,[4] was the thirteenth round of the 2021 World Championship.[3] The race took place one week after the Belgian Grand Prix and precedes the Italian Grand Prix. The race was also championship contender, Max Verstappen's home Grand Prix.

Track layout[edit]
The circuit has a total length of 4.259 kilometres (2.646 mi), consisting of 14 corners and two DRS zones. As one of the shorter tracks on the Formula One calendar, the drivers complete 72 laps resulting in a total race distance of 306.587 kilometres (190.504 mi).

Championship standings before the race[edit]
After the Belgian Grand Prix handed out half-points due to heavy rainfall,[5] Lewis Hamilton's championship lead was reduced to just three points to Verstappen in second. For the second race in a row, Lando Norris, Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Pérez all scored no points, meaning they stayed third, fourth and fifth respectively.[6] Mercedes also led the Constructors' Championship by 7 points to Red Bull. McLaren regained third place after Daniel Ricciardo scored six points. Ferrari trailed McLaren by 3.5 points and Alpine sat in fifth place.[7]

Entrants[edit]
See also: 2021 Formula One World Championship § Entries
The drivers and teams were initially the same as the season entry list with no additional stand-in drivers for the race.[8]
Before the third practice session, Alfa Romeo Racing driver Kimi Räikkönen tested positive for coronavirus.[9] He was replaced by the reserve driver Robert Kubica, who last raced at the 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, driving for Williams.[10]
Williams team principal Jost Capito also had to go into isolation following a dinner with Räikkönen the night before.[11]

Tyre choices[edit]
Sole tyre supplier Pirelli allocated the C1, C2, and C3 compounds of tyre to be used in the race.[12]

Practice[edit]
Free practice 1 took place at 11:30 CEST on 3 September, while free practice 2 took place at 15:00 CEST on the same day. Free practice 3 took place at 12:00 CEST on 4 September.[4] All three practice sessions lasted for one hour.
The first session ended with Lewis Hamilton fastest for Mercedes ahead of Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz Jr. The session was red flagged for 35 minutes after an engine failure of Aston Martin's Sebastian Vettel.[13]
The second session ended with Charles Leclerc fastest for Ferrari ahead of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. and Alpine's Esteban Ocon. The session was red flagged for nine minutes after a loss of power for Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton. The session was also red flagged for Haas's Nikita Mazepin after he spun into a gravel trap.[14] Verstappen was investigated by the stewards for overtaking another driver during the first red flag period of the session, though the stewards ultimately decided a penalty was not necessary.[15][16]

Qualifying[edit]
Qualifying took place at 15:00 CEST on 4 September.[4]

Notes[edit]


^ a b Nikita Mazepin is Russian, but he competed as a neutral competitor using the designation RAF (Russian Automobile Federation), as the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld a ban on Russia competing at World Championships. The ban was implemented by the World Anti-Doping Agency in response to the state-sponsored doping program of Russian athletes.[17]
