Motor car race
The winning Vanwall, VW5, before the start of the race. It was shared by Tony Brooks and Stirling Moss, who both played a part in scoring the constructor's first Formula One win.
All but one of the Maserati 250Fs retired from the race.
The 1957 British Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 20 July 1957 at the Aintree Circuit, near Liverpool. It was the tenth British Grand Prix and it was race 5 of 8 in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers. The race was won by Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks, who shared driving duties in a Vanwall. It was the third and final time that a Grand Prix had been won by two drivers in a shared car. This was the first occasion that a British constructor won a World Drivers' Championship race, a feat achieved with two British drivers at their home Grand Prix.
