1954

The 37th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Saturday, May 30, 1953. The event was part of the 1953 AAA National Championship, and was race 2 of 9 in the 1953 World Championship of Drivers. Bill Vukovich, after falling just short a year before, dominated the race, leading 195 of the 200 laps. Vukovich won the first of two consecutive "500" victories, finishing more than three minutes ahead of second place Art Cross.
With the temperature in the high 90s (°F), and the track temperature exceeding 130 °F (54 °C), this race is often known as the "Hottest 500". Only twelve cars were running at the finish. Many starters needed relief drivers, and some relief drivers required their own relief drivers. Vukovich and Cross, however, both ran the full 500 miles solo. Owing to the excruciating conditions, driver Carl Scarborough dropped out of the race, and later died at the infield hospital due to heat prostration.[3][4] Not only were drivers and crew members suffering from the intense heat, but spectators as well. According to one of the doctors at the infield hospital, the number of persons requiring treatment at the hospital was "beyond comprehension". This included at least eleven members of  the Purdue Band, who marched and preformed during pre-race ceremonies.[5]


Time trials[edit]
On Friday May 15, one day prior to the opening of time trials, sixteen-year race veteran Chet Miller died in a crash in turn one.[6] Going into the race, Miller was the 1-lap (139.600 mph) and 4-lap (139.034 mph) track record holder (139.600 mph), a mark that he set in 1952. After completing a fast lap of over 138 mph, Miller went low going into turn one. The back end got loose, then the car turned to the right and drove head-on into the outside retaining wall. The car slid along the outside wall for about 100 yards, and came to rest in the south short chute. Miller,  was found dead of a basal skull fracture and brain hemorrhage and likely was killed instantly.[7]

Saturday May 16[edit]
The first day of time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 15, but was rained out. Pole qualifying was rescheduled for Sunday at 12 p.m.[8]

Sunday May 17[edit]
Morning rain delayed the start of time trials until about 2:20 p.m. Only twelve drivers managed to take to the track, and seven completed a qualifying attempt. Manny Ayulo was the first driver in the field, completing his run at a speed of 136.384 mph. Bill Vukovich won the pole position with a four-lap average speed of 138.392 mph, which was not a new track record. Vukovich famously completed his qualifying run in the rain. On his third lap, his car slid sideways going into turn one due to increasing dampness, but he stayed with it. On his fourth and final lap, as Vukovich was coming out of turn four, the skies opened up and a downpour ensued. The speed on his last lap slipped to 137 mph, but he nevertheless took the checkered flag. The track was closed and Vukovich secured the pole position.[9][10][11]

Saturday May 23[edit]
The third day of time trials opened with 26 spots still open in the starting grid. With as many as 66 cars in the paddock looking for a chance to qualify, the schedule for time trials was extended to 10 a.m. to 7 p.m..[12] A very busy day saw 45 total qualifying attempts; 27 cars completed an attempt. The field was filled to 33 cars, and one car (Joe Barzda) was bumped. 
Johnnie Parsons, the 1950 winner, was the fastest driver of the day. His speed of 137.667 mph wound up being the third-fastest overall in the field, but as a third day qualifier, he was forced to line up in 8th starting spot (middle of row 3). The threat of rain added to the urgency of the day. However, the rain held off throughout most of the afternoon. Two drivers (Marshall Teague and Eddie Johnson) exhausted all three of their allotted attempts. Teague slid sideways in turn two during his attempt, but would hold on to make the field. Johnson would later be bumped.
No incidents were reported during the day. Art Cross threw a rod during his first attempt. He took over the car of Jimmy Reece, and qualified 12th. Among those not yet in the field was Henry Banks.[13][14]

Sunday May 24[edit]
Bump Day, the fourth and final day of time trials, was held on Sunday May 24. With the field already filled to 33 cars, the bumping process began right away. A total of six cars were bumped. Len Duncan was the first driver bumped for the day, after the successful run of Jimmy Bryan. Duncan later got in a backup car, but wrecked it in a practice run. Frank Armi spun out in turn two and also failed to make the race. Both Duncan and Armi would return to the make the race in 1954.
Bill Holland, the 1949 winner, returned to Indianapolis after being suspended by AAA for competing in "outlaw" races. Holland's car from the previous Sunday was bumped, but he took over the John Finch machine. He put in a speed of 137.868 mph, and became the second-fastest car overall in the field. Johnnie Tolan got out on the track with five seconds left before the 7 o'clock gun. His speed of 134.852 mph, however, was too slow to make the field.[16][17]

Race summary[edit]
First half[edit]
Race day dawned hot, with temperatures climbing into the 90s. The command to start engines was given at 10:54 a.m., and the field pulled away for the pace lap. At start, Bill Vukovich took the lead from the pole position, and led the field into turn one. Manny Ayulo and Tony Bettenhausen battled for second as Vukovich pulled out to a comfortable lead. On lap 4, Andy Linden crashed in turn three. Jerry Hoyt spun to the infield grass to avoid the wreck. Linden was out, but Hoyt was able to continue in the race. The yellow light stayed on for about one lap, and Linden was not injured.
Vukovich surrendered the lead during his first pit stop on lap 48. That put Fred Agabashian in the lead for one lap, followed by Jim Rathmann, then Sam Hanks for two laps. After the leaders cycled through their stops, Vukovich was back in the lead on lap 54. At the same time, Gene Hartley spun out in turn four bringing out the second yellow of the day. Hartley was taken to the infield hospital, but was released and would be able to serve as a relief driver later in the day.
The grueling conditions were starting to take a toll on the field. Several cars dropped out with mechanical problems before the halfway point. Jimmy Davies came into the pits without brakes, and brushed the inside wall to slow the car down. He would stay in the race to finish 10th, but several laps down. When Duke Nalon came in for his pit stop, his crew dumped a bucket of water over his head. On lap 70, Carl Scarborough came into the pits, feeling sick from the heat and fumes. Due to a fuel spill, a small fire broke out on the side of the car. The fire was quickly extinguished, and Scarborough climbed over the pit wall where he collapsed onto a chair.[22] Bob Scott, who had already dropped out with an oil leak, took over behind the wheel. Scarborough was taken to the infield hospital where his temperature was recorded as 104 °F (40 °C). Physicians unsuccessfully performed open-heart massage, but he died of what was reported as heat prostration.[23][24] According to speedway historian Donald Davidson, Scarborough may have inhaled carbon dioxide from the fire extinguishers, which may have contributed to, or been the actual cause of death.
With 80 laps completed, Bill Vukovich was still leading, with Art Cross second and Fred Agabashian third. Don Freeland lost a wheel in turn one on the leader's lap 81, and he spun down to the infield grass. He was unhurt, but the car was finished. Johnnie Parsons dropped out with a blown engine on lap 86, and Duane Carter was out with ignition problems.

Second half[edit]
At the halfway point, Bill Vukovich led with Fred Agabashian in second and Sam Hanks in third. Agabashian came in for a pit stop on lap 104. Agabashian was overcome by the heat and the engine fumes, and had to be replaced in the cockpit by relief driver Paul Russo. Jim Rathmann did the same, handing his car over to Eddie Johnson on lap 113. Vukovich came in for his second pit stop on lap 112, followed by Hanks four laps later. Back out on the track, Vukovich had a 50-second lead over Hanks.
Pat Flaherty hit the wall in the northchute on the leaders' lap 118. The yellow light was turned on for 6 minutes and 50 seconds to clean up the oil and fluids that spilled on the track. The next driver to fall by the wayside was Tony Bettenhausen. After completing 115 laps, Bettenhausen came into the pits signaling for a relief driver. Chuck Stevenson took over the car as Bettenhausen passed out and collapsed to the ground from the heat. After a lengthy period of rest, Jim Rathmann got back in the race. Rathmann took over the car of Bill Holland, but it ultimately broke down with a magneto failure.
At the 150-lap mark (375 miles), Bill Vukovich had lapped the field. Manny Ayulo was running second, and Sam Hanks in third. Ayulo's day ended after 184 laps with engine failure. Hanks came in on lap 151, and he was the next to need a relief driver. Duane Carter got behind the wheel, but the team lost considerable time as the crew had to repair a broken exhaust pipe. Marshall Teague came in on lap 169 needing assistance climbing out of the car. Cal Niday was preparing to take over behind the wheel, but the car had an oil leak and was done for the day.
Bill Vukovich made his final pit stop on lap 171. Henry Banks was reportedly standing by in Vukovich's pit, with his helmet on ready to drive relief. Vukovich, however, refused the help and insisted on driving the full 500 miles solo. He drank a cup of water, poured some water down the back of his shirt, and went back out on the track. Radio network reporter Luke Walton labeled Vukovich the "ironman" of the race. Walton described the day as the "hottest day we've had in Hoosierland since Willkie accepted the nomination in Elwood back in 1940".[25]
Vukovich cruised over the final 30 laps and won his first "500" by 3 minutes and 30 seconds (about 3 laps) over second place Art Cross. Duane Carter (driving the car of Sam Hanks) came home third, with Paul Russo (driving the car of Fred Agabashian) fourth. As Vukovich was headed to victory lane, the action on the track was still hot. Gene Hartley (driving Tony Bettenhausen's car) crashed, as did Duke Nalon. Officials flagged the race after the first eight cars finished. Only four other cars were still running.

Race notes[edit]
Pole position: Bill Vukovich – 4:20.13 (4 laps)
Fastest lead lap: Bill Vukovich – 1:06.240
The purse for first place was $89,496[29] (US$1,019,186 in 2023 dollars[30]).
One of the prizes awarded to the winner was a pet dog and a year's supply of dog food.[31]
Broadcasting[edit]
Radio[edit]
The race was carried live flag-to-flag on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. Instead of being produced by 1070 WIBC-AM, the network pooled together talent and technical staff from all five of the major radio stations in Indianapolis. The broadcast was anchored by Sid Collins, and featured on-air talent from WIBC, WFBM, WISH, WIRE, and WXLW.[32]
The broadcast signed on at 10:45 a.m. local time, and carried live through the conclusion, until 3:45 p.m. local time. The broadcast was carried on 135 stations in at least 35 states across the country, and on Armed Forced Network to Europe and Asia. Towards the end of the race, chief announcer Sid Collins departed the booth in order to report from victory lane. Charlie Brockman, the color commentator and co-announcer, called the last few laps including the finish.

Background[edit]
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. "Pop" Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.[33][34]
Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers.[35] However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations.[36] The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors' Championship.

Summary[edit]
The 1953 Indianapolis 500 was round 2 of 9 on the 1953 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit. Race winner Bill Vukovich earned 9 points towards the World Championship (8 points for first place, and 1 point for the fastest lap). Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished seventh in the final season standings.
