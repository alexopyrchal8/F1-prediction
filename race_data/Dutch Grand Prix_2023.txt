Motor car race
The 2023 Dutch Grand Prix (officially known as the Formula 1 Heineken Dutch Grand Prix 2023) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 27 August 2023 at the Circuit Zandvoort in Zandvoort, the Netherlands. It was the thirteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship.
The race, largely affected by wet weather conditions, was won by Red Bull Racing driver Max Verstappen, who started from pole position, followed by Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Pierre Gasly of Alpine, Gasly's first podium of the season. Verstappen's victory was his ninth in a row, equaling Sebastian Vettel's record. The race featured the Grand Prix debut of Liam Lawson, substituting for AlphaTauri driver Daniel Ricciardo when the latter broke a metacarpal bone during a practice session.


Background[edit]
The event was held across the weekend of 25–27 August. It was the thirteenth round of the 2023 Formula One World Championship and the 35th running of the Dutch Grand Prix.[2]

Championship standings before the race[edit]
Coming into the weekend, Max Verstappen led the Drivers' Championship by 125 points from teammate Sergio Pérez, with Fernando Alonso third, a further 40 points behind. Red Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship, leading Mercedes by 256 points and Aston Martin by a further 51 points.[3]

Entrants[edit]
See also: 2023 Formula One World Championship § Entries
The drivers and teams were initially the same as the season entry list with the exception of Daniel Ricciardo, who replaced Nyck de Vries at AlphaTauri from the Hungarian Grand Prix onwards.[4][5] However, Ricciardo broke a metacarpal bone in his left hand in a crash in the second practice session, and was subsequently replaced by reserve driver Liam Lawson who made his Formula One race debut.[6][7] Robert Shwartzman drove for Ferrari in place of Carlos Sainz Jr. during the first practice session.[8]

Tyre choices[edit]
Further information: Formula One tyres
Tyre supplier Pirelli brought the C1, C2 and C3 tyre compounds (designated hard, medium, and soft, respectively) for teams to use at the event.[9]

Practice[edit]
Three free practice sessions were held for the event. The first practice session was held on 25 August 2023, at 12:30 local time (UTC+2); it was red-flagged once as Nico Hülkenberg crashed at the last corner. Max Verstappen topped the session, with Fernando Alonso the second-fastest and Lewis Hamilton third.[10]
The second free practice session was held on 25 August 2023, at 16:00 local time (UTC+2) and was topped by Lando Norris, with Verstappen the second-fastest and Alexander Albon third. The session was red-flagged when Oscar Piastri and Daniel Ricciardo crashed moments apart at turn 3. The accident resulted in a broken metacarpal bone in Ricciardo's left hand. He was deemed unfit to participate in further sessions throughout the weekend; Red Bull Racing and AlphaTauri's reserve driver Liam Lawson replaced Ricciardo for the remainder of the weekend.[11] The third free practice session was held on 26 August 2023, at 11:30 local time (UTC+2) in wet conditions. Verstappen topped it with George Russell being second and Sergio Pérez third. The session was red-flagged three times for Kevin Magnussen's crash and spins of Zhou Guanyu and Liam Lawson.[12]

Qualifying[edit]
Qualifying was held on 26 August 2023, at 15:00 local time (UTC+2).[13]

Race report[edit]
The race was affected by wet weather conditions and was won by Verstappen. It was his ninth victory in a row, equaling Sebastian Vettel's record.[18] Alonso set his first fastest lap since the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix.[19] Alonso finished second for Aston Martin while Pierre Gasly finished third for Alpine, the latter gaining a position after Pérez received a five-second time penalty.[20] Heavy rainfall and Zhou Guanyu's crash eight laps from the finish meant the race was suspended for three-quarters of an hour before resuming.[21] The podium finish was Gasly's first since the 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and his first as an Alpine driver.[22]
