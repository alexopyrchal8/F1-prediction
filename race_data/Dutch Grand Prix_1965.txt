It was race 6 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The 80-lap race was won by Lotus driver Jim Clark after he started from second position. Jackie Stewart finished second for the BRM team and Brabham driver Dan Gurney came in third.

There was drama before the race when Lotus boss Colin Chapman punched a policeman, Chapman was arrested hours after the race but the Dutch police kept him in for two days.
Honda capitalised on their long hours of testing at Zandvoort when Ginther claimed a front-row space with Graham Hill and Clark. He shot into the lead for the first 2 laps. Hill took the lead and then Clark overtook him on lap 6. Hill fell back with rev counter problems and Stewart was left to duel with first Gurney and then Clark-ending up with a Scottish 1–2.
