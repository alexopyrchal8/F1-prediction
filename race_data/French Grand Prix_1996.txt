Motor car race
The 1996 French Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit de Nevers, Magny-Cours, France on 30 June 1996. It was the ninth race of the 1996 Formula One World Championship.
The 72-lap race was won by Briton Damon Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, after he started from second position. German Michael Schumacher took pole position in his Ferrari but failed to start the race after his engine blew on the warm-up lap, leaving Hill to lead from start to finish except for the pit stops. Hill's teammate, Canadian Jacques Villeneuve, finished second, with local driver Jean Alesi third in a Benetton-Renault.
This was the last Grand Prix where a Forti car started the race as they would fail to qualify for the remaining Grand Prix they would enter, however both cars were forced to retire.[3]

Notes[edit]
This section contains a list of miscellaneous information. Please relocate any relevant information into other sections or articles. (March 2021)
Jacques Villeneuve crashed heavily at Estoril corner in qualifying, when the front end of his Williams went wide and smashed the left side of his car in the barriers. The car was repaired in time for race day.
Eddie Irvine had qualified 10th, but had all his qualifying times deleted and was demoted to the back of the grid after one of the air deflectors on his Ferrari was found to be too tall.[7]
Pole-sitter Michael Schumacher had an engine failure during the formation lap and was unable to start the race. This would be the last time a Ferrari driver was unable to start a Grand Prix from pole position until Charles Leclerc failed to start the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix from pole position due to a driveshaft problem.
