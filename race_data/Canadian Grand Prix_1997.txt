The 1997 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on 15 June 1997. The race was stopped early on lap 54 after a big crash involving Olivier Panis, who broke his legs and would be unable to start the next seven Grands Prix. Michael Schumacher won ahead of Jean Alesi in the Benetton and Giancarlo Fisichella in the Jordan. David Coulthard had been leading, but was delayed for over a lap by a clutch problem during his second pit stop, shortly before Panis's crash. On lap 2, local driver Jacques Villeneuve crashed into the wall on the exit of the final corner. This wall  would later be known as the 'Wall of Champions', after three former World Champions, including Villeneuve, crashed into it separately in the 1999 race.
It also marked the debut of Alexander Wurz, driving for Benetton in place of his compatriot Gerhard Berger. Berger had been suffering from a sinus illness for some time and during his time off his father was killed in a light aircraft accident.[2]


Classification[edit]
Qualifying[edit]
The bigest surprise was Rubens Barrichello qualifying his Stewart on third spot, best position to the new team at that point. During the weekend the team tried a F-3000 rear wing to improve their downforce balance. The Brazilian was the best Bridgestone tyre supplied car qualifier; the second best was Frenchman Olivier Panis, only 10th.

Race[edit]
At the start, Eddie Irvine and Mika Häkkinen tangled at turn 2 and collected Jan Magnussen, with all three drivers immediately retiring. Rubens Barrichello made a bad start and dropped from third to seventh. On lap 2, local hero Jacques Villeneuve crashed out at the final chicane. Four laps later Ukyo Katayama retired and the Safety Car was deployed. The race resumed with both Tyrrell's drivers Jos Verstappen and Mika Salo passing Rubens Barrichello, running heavy on fuel on a one-stop strategy. When Ralf Schumacher retired, Jos Verstappen climbed to sixth place. The dream of the Dutchman to score his first point of the season faded away on lap 42; four laps later the same happened to his teammate.
At the front, Michael Schumacher established a gap around ten seconds to David Coulthard until his first stop. Then the McLaren driver took the lead until his only stop, dropping again to second, and coming back to the field around eight seconds behind the German. As the Ferrari driver needed a second stop to refueling, the lead would came back to Coulthard on lap 44. Schumacher exited the pit behind Olivier Panis and soon lapped the Frenchman, seventh at the time. However the German struggled on his new set of tyres and was unlapped by Panis, giving an even more comfortable lead to Coulthard.
Enjoying a reasonable gap to second spot and concerning about blistering on his left rear tyre, David Coulthard pitted for the second time, but his clutch failed and the car stalled on box. Thus, the lead came back to Michael Schumacher, at the same time that Olivier Panis crashed heavily on tyre barrier at turn 5, bringing out the Safety Car for the second time as well as the Medical Car.
The Frenchman was rapidly extracted from his Prost car and laid down with pain in his legs, leaving the track on an ambulance. Three laps later the race was red flagged and finished, giving Michael Schumacher the Championship lead, Giancarlo Fisichella his very first podium and Shinji Nakano his first Formula One career point.
