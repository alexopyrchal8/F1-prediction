Report[edit]
Background[edit]
Michael Schumacher and Ferrari were already the drivers' and constructors' world champions. After the 2004 Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher unassailably led the drivers' standings with 38 points ahead of Rubens Barrichello and 65 points ahead of Jenson Button. Ferrari led the constructors' championship with 140 points, unassailable ahead of BAR and 143 points ahead of Renault.
Renault fired Jarno Trulli after the Italian Grand Prix and was replaced by Jacques Villeneuve, who returned to driving a single-seater after almost a year of inactivity. The dismissal of the Italian driver was due to disagreements with team manager Flavio Briatore, who also dominated the Italian driver's career and who the previous week had signed a contract with Toyota for 2005.[3] This was the first race back for Ralf Schumacher after injuries in the 2004 United States Grand Prix three months prior. At Jordan, Timo Glock replaced Giorgio Pantano, who will give up participation in the last three Grand Prix races of the season without paying the last installment according to the contract.[4]
The race was the first where radio conversations between teams and drivers were broadcast to television viewers.[5]

Practice[edit]
The BAR of test driver Anthony Davidson takes to the track in friday free practice with a special yellow-blue livery, inspired by that of the Subaru Impreza 555 and which replaces the main seasonal sponsor Lucky Strike with State Express 555. The intention was to use it throughout the weekend. However, this was suspended by the federation so that for qualifying and the race, while retaining the temporary 555 sponsorship, the season's canonical white livery was more or less restored.[6]

Qualifying[edit]
Barrichello set the fastest lap and took pole position ahead of Räikkönen and Button. The Bridgestone tyres worked particularly well in this section and Sauber driver Massa managed to achieve the best starting position of his career up to that point with fourth place.

Race[edit]
After changing the engine during the night, Michael Schumacher started from the pit lane and started the race with a full tank. Barrichello maintained his lead at the start ahead of Räikkönen. Alonso took third place ahead of Massa and Button. The Briton regained position from the Sauber driver on the third lap after an intense duel. A lap later, Massa was also overtaken by Fisichella and Ralf Schumacher. Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher was struggling to get himself back together and was stuck in seventeenth behind the Toyota of Panis, which got off to a terrible start due to a launch control problem. On lap six, Button also overtook Alonso and moved up to third place, the BAR driver immediately setting the fastest lap of the race. After ten laps of the race, Massa opened the first series of pit stops. Shortly afterwards, Michael Schumacher touched Klien while trying to overtake the Austrian. While Michael Schumacher was able to continue driving, Klien's race was over due to damaged suspension.
Barrichello and Räikkönen refuelled together on lap 12. The Brazilian kept the Finn behind him. Alonso and Button stayed on the track one and two laps longer respectively and retained fourth and third place. Further back, Michael Schumacher skidded and lost a lot of time. The German driver was the last to refuel on the 20th lap after overtaking both Fisichella and his brother.
At the head of the race, Barrichello struggled to contain Räikkönen; the Ferrari driver's margin over the Finn remained firmly under one second. In third position followed, a little further behind, Button; However, the British driver started with a two-stop strategy, compared to his rivals' three. Alonso retained his fourth place, ahead of Ralf Schumacher, Fisichella and Coulthard. Räikkönen refuelled for the second time on lap 27; when Barrichello also made his second pit stop, two laps later, his advantage over the Finn increased. Button then took the lead, refuelling on lap 35. At the same moment, Michael Schumacher punctured a tyre, losing even more ground to the lead. Toyota driver Zonta retired with gearbox damage.
On lap 36, Räikkönen made his third and final pit stop, anticipating it in an attempt to overtake Barrichello; However, the Finn returned to the track behind Button, in third place. One lap later, Coulthard and Ralf Schumacher came into contact while fighting for seventh place; the Briton rammed the Williams driver and both were forced into the pits, Coulthard to replace a punctured tyre and Ralf Schumacher to carry out checks. However, the German driver returned to the pits just as his team was waiting for Montoya; Schumacher therefore lost two laps and, after carrying out a test lap, returned to the pits definitively. A little later, Minardi driver Bruni, who had lost a wheel, also retired.
Meanwhile, Barrichello pushed hard to increase his lead over Button as much as possible; when the Brazilian refuelled during the 42nd lap, the BAR driver remained behind him. In the final laps Barrichello managed his advantage over his pursuers, who approached the Ferrari driver but never seriously threatened him.
Barrichello then obtained his second consecutive victory, ahead of Button, Räikkönen, Alonso, Montoya, Sato, Fisichella and Massa; Villeneuve, returning after a year of inactivity, took only eleventh place, finishing ahead of Michael Schumacher. In the fight for second place in the Constructors' Championship, BAR gained further points over Renault, having overtaken it in the standings in the previous Grand Prix.
