Motor car race
The 1965 Monaco Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Monaco on 30 May 1965. It was race 2 of 10 in both the 1965 World Championship of Drivers and the 1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers, albeit held almost five months after the first race of the season. The 100-lap race was won by BRM driver Graham Hill from pole position. Lorenzo Bandini finished second for the Ferrari team and Hill's teammate Jackie Stewart came in third.
Jim Clark, Dan Gurney and Mike Spence did not participate in this race, since Team Lotus chose to race in the 1965 Indy 500, held the following day and won by Clark.[1] As of 2023[update], this is the second and last time a driver has crashed into the harbour, with Paul Hawkins falling in on lap 79, after the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix accident of Alberto Ascari.


Race report[edit]
Hill and Stewart, both in BRMs, led the race from the start. Both spun, Hill after the car in front of him sprayed the track with parts, and Bandini took over the lead. Brabham, using the new, 32-valve Coventry Climax FWMV Mark 7 engine, overtook Bandini until the new engine blew up on the 43rd lap. Ferrari was now in first and second, with Bandini using the flat-twelve design (Ferrari 1512) while Surtees had opted for the V8-engined Ferrari 158. Hill, however, had stayed in the race and was steadily closing in. During the chase, the lap record was beaten several times.[1] On lap 65, Hill had gotten past both Ferraris and went on to build up a sizable lead, eventually winning by over a minute. Surtees ran out of petrol on the last lap, allowing Stewart to pip him for third place, with McLaren and Siffert rounding out the points-paying positions. After debuting with Brabham at the previous race, Honda also made use of Goodyear rather than Dunlop tires in this race.[1]
