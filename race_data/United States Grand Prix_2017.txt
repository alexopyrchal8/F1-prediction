Motor car race
The 2017 United States Grand Prix (formally known as the 2017 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on October 22, 2017, at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, United States as the seventeenth round of the 2017 FIA Formula One World Championship.[6] The race marked the forty-seventh running of the United States Grand Prix, the thirty-ninth time that the race was run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in 1950, and the sixth time that a World Championship round was held at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas.
Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the round with a 59-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the World Drivers' Championship. Hamilton's teammate Valtteri Bottas was third, a further 13 points behind. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a lead of 155 points over Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing a further 92 points behind in third place.
Mercedes clinched its fourth successive World Constructors' Championship after Hamilton won and Bottas finished 5th.


Background[edit]
Driver changes[edit]

Brendon Hartley made his Formula One debut with Scuderia Toro Rosso.
Carlos Sainz Jr. moved from Toro Rosso to Renault and replaced Jolyon Palmer.[7] Daniil Kvyat returned to Toro Rosso after having missed the Malaysian and Japanese Grands Prix, taking over Sainz's car.[8][a] Pierre Gasly missed the round to compete in the final weekend of the 2017 Super Formula Championship and was replaced at Toro Rosso by the 2015 World Endurance Champion Brendon Hartley, who made his Formula One début;[10][9] this was the first time a New Zealander participated in a Formula One race in 33 years.[citation needed]

Tyres[edit]
Tyre supplier Pirelli provided teams with the ultra-soft, super-soft and soft compounds of tyre. The purple branding on the ultra-soft compound was replaced by pink for the race to raise awareness of breast cancer. Several teams also incorporated pink into their liveries to support the cause (except Force India, whose cars were pink to begin with).

Bold text and an asterisk indicates competitors who still had a theoretical chance of becoming World Champion.
Notes[edit]


^ Daniil Kvyat drove the car that Carlos Sainz Jr. had previously competed in rather than the car he had driven in the first fourteen rounds of the championship.[9]

^ Although Brendon Hartley made his Formula One début in the race, he received a grid penalty because power unit components are assigned to the car rather than the driver. Hartley thus received the penalty because the car's previous drivers, Daniil Kvyat and Pierre Gasly,[9] had used up the quota of power unit components.
