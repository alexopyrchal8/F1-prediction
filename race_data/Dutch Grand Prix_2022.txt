Race[edit]
Race report[edit]
The race took place on 4 September, starting at 15:00 CEST, and lasting 72 laps.[8] Verstappen lead away from pole, with Leclerc, Sainz and Hamilton behind. Kevin Magnussen scraped the barriers on lap 2, demoting him to the back of the field. On lap 18, Carlos Sainz Jr. had a slow pit stop as his tyres were not ready; the mechanics also misplaced the spare wheel gun in an unsafe position which Pérez ran over. The slow pitstop demoted Sainz to eleventh. On lap 45, Yuki Tsunoda's AlphaTauri pulled over with an issue on the front-left tyre. Tsunoda was told to continue and came in a lap later, for a change of tyres and to tighten his seatbelt, which he had loosened as he prepared to abandon his car. On lap 47, Tsunoda retired with a differential issue. This brought out a virtual safety car, allowing Verstappen to make a pit stop to keep the lead ahead of the two Mercedes. On lap 55, Valtteri Bottas retired with an engine issue, bringing out a full safety car. Hamilton stayed out, while Verstappen and Russell pitted for softs. Verstappen overtook Hamilton at the restart almost immediately, while Sainz received a five-second penalty for an unsafe release during his pit stop. After Russell made a split-second decision to pit again for faster softs, he overtook Hamilton, who fell to fourth after being overtaken by Leclerc as well. The final standings saw Verstappen in first place, winning the 30th race in his career and the fourth race in a row, ahead of Russell in second and Leclerc in third. Sainz’s penalty demoted him from fifth to eighth. The race was viewed as Hamilton’s best chance of victory, but because of the bad strategy call, he didn’t even finish on the podium.

Post race[edit]
Following the race, a conspiracy theory emerged accusing Red Bull Racing strategist Hannah Schmitz of conspiring with sister team AlphaTauri to ensure a favourable result for Verstappen, after questioning the nature of Tsunoda's retirement on lap 47 which helped Verstappen take a pit stop with a reduced time loss, due to the virtual safety car. This followed the post-race comments of Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff who openly admitted to being suspicious about the circumstances of Tsunoda's retirement saying he was left "speechless" by the incident and that he may have had inspected the incident more closely had his driver Lewis Hamilton been a realistic contender to win the drivers championship.[13] AlphaTauri responded to the accusations, stating Tsunoda's car had a genuine problem the team was initially not aware of.[14] Media sources also criticised the conspiracy theories surrounding Tsunoda's retirement.[15] The incident was looked into by race stewards, whose only action was to reprimand Tsunoda for having his belts undone.[14][16]
