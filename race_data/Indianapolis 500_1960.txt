The 44th International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Monday, May 30, 1960. The event was race 2 of 12 of the 1960 USAC National Championship Trail and was also race 3 of 10 in the 1960 World Championship of Drivers. It would be the final time World Championship points would be awarded at the Indy 500.
Often regarded as the greatest two-man duel in Indianapolis 500 history, the 1960 race saw a then-record 29 lead changes (a record that stood until 2012). Jim Rathmann and Rodger Ward battled out nearly the entire second half. Rathmann took the lead for good on lap 197 after Ward was forced to slow down with a worn out tire.[3] Rathmann's margin of victory of 12.75 seconds was the second-closest finish in Indy history at the time.
The inaugural 500 Festival Open Invitation was held at the Speedway Golf Course in the four days leading up to the race.


Time trials[edit]
Time trials was scheduled for four days, but the third day was rained out.

Saturday May 14 – Pole Day time trials
Eddie Sachs set a track record of 146.592 mph to win the pole position.
Sunday May 15 – Second day time trials
Saturday May 21 – Third day time trials
The third day of time trials was rained out.
Sunday May 22 – Fourth day time trials
Jim Hurtubise nearly broke the elusive and much-anticipated 150 mph barrier. Hurtubise's four-lap qualifying average of 149.056 mph featured a new one-lap record of 149.601 mph (on lap 3), to establish himself as the fastest qualifier in the field.[4]
After Carburetion tests, Dempsey Wilson replaced Jimmy Daywalt as the driver for the #23 entry, and the car was moved to the rear of the starting grid.[5]

Race recap[edit]
First half[edit]
The race started out with four contenders in the first half. Rodger Ward took the lead on lap 1 from the outside of the front row. Ward led the first lap. But polesitter Eddie Sachs took the lead on lap 2. Two laps later, Ward was back in front, and the record-setting number of lead changes was already under way. Troy Ruttman and Jim Rathmann also took turns at the front.
The first caution came out on lap 47 when Duane Carter spun in turn 3. He did not hit the wall, and came to a rest in the infield grass. Carter was able to continue. Moments later, Don Branson came into the pits, but came in too hot. He lost control and did a half spin, tagging the pit wall. The crew jumped out the way, and no one was injured. The damage was minimal, and Branson was able to continue.
On lap 66, Jim McWithey came into the pits without any brakes. He brushed the inside pit wall trying to slow the car down, but  failed to stop. He continued through the pit lane and finally came to rest in the infield grass in turn 1. On lap 88 Eddie Russo hit the wall exiting turn two, and slid down the backstretch. Russo was taken to the hospital for a scalp wound and a concussion. During the yellow for Russo's crash, Wayne Weiler brushed the wall in turn two. His car suffered suspension damage, and he dropped out after 103 laps.
The green came back out on lap 100, but almost immediately, the yellow light was back on. Chuck Stevenson spun in the south short-chute exiting the pits. Stevenson was able to continue in the race. It was the fourth and final yellow light period of the afternoon. The green came back out for good on lap 110.
Rodger Ward had stalled his engine twice during his first pit stop, losing considerable ground. After getting back on the track, he started charging to catch up to the front of the field.[8] Shortly after the halfway point, Eddie Sachs and Troy Ruttman would both drop out of the race, ultimately leaving Rathmann and Ward to battle it out in front.

Second half[edit]
On about lap 124, Tony Bettenhausen came in for a routine pit stop. He complained of a smoking engine, but returned to the track. One lap later, he was back in the pits with a fire and a blown engine. Bettenhausen was unhurt, but hoisted himself out of the cockpit as it was coasting to stop in the pits to avoid getting burned. Safety crew extinguished the fire and no one was injured.
In the second half, Rodger Ward had caught up to Jim Rathmann, with Johnny Thomson close behind in third. Rathmann and Ward swapped the lead several times, meanwhile Ward was hoping that the pace would slow down, in order to save his tires to the end. After stalling in the pits earlier, the hard charge Ward made to get back to the front was a concern. He feared that that he had worn out his tires prematurely. Ward was aware of Rathmann's tendencies as a driver, and allowed Rathmann to pass him for the lead. Rathmann had a reputation for charging hard to take the lead, but once he was in the lead, he would often back the pace down.[8] Ward's prediction came true, but it was at the expense of losing ground to third place. Johnny Thomson was now catching up. Thomson's day was not without incident, however. He blew a right right rear tire around lap 145; but it occurred as he was already pulling into his pit stall for a routine pit stop. 
Ward and Rathmann came in for their final scheduled pit stops on lap 148. Ward's crew had him out first, with Rathmann right behind.
With 48 laps to go, three cars were on the lead lap. Rathmann now led Ward, and Thomson was just ten second behind in third place. With Thomson closing in on the leaders, Ward and Rathmann started charging again, racing each other hard, swapping the lead several times between themselves. Thomson narrowed the deficit to about 8 seconds, but on lap 172 his engine started losing power. He slowed and wound up nursing his car to a 5th-place finish.
Inside ten laps to go, Rodger Ward seemed to have the faster car, and he took the lead on lap 194. He was less than six laps from victory. A few laps later though, Ward observed the cords in his right front tire showing, and he backed off the pace. Jim Rathmann took the lead for good on lap 197, and pulled away for victory. Due to Ward's experience as a tire tester, he was able to nurse his car to the finish line without pitting to change the bad tire. He finished second place, about 12 seconds behind Rathmann.[3] Despite winning twice (1959 and 1962), Rodger Ward often considered this race his personal best.[8]
Paul Goldsmith charged from 26th starting position to finish 3rd, holding off 4th place Don Branson by about a car length.

Race notes[edit]
Fastest Lead Lap: Jim Rathmann – 1:01.59
The 1960 Indianapolis 500 was the final 500 which featured a 33-car field consisting of all front-engined cars.
The weather on race day would reach a high of 75 °F (24 °C) with wind speeds up to 15 miles per hour (24 km/h).[10] Climate historians would consider this to be the "traditional" climate for an Indianapolis 500 race.
Despite some published claims that it was Smokey Yunick,[11] the race-winning chief mechanic for Rathmann was Takeo "Chickie" Hirashima.[12]
Spectator fatalities[edit]
Two spectators in the infield, Fred H. Linder, 36, of Indianapolis, and William C. Craig, 37, of Zionsville, were killed, and as many as 82 were injured, when a homemade scaffolding collapsed. Approximately 125–130 patrons had paid a small fee ($5–$10) to view the race from the 30-foot tall scaffolding, erected by a private individual (Wilbur Shortridge, Jr.[13]) and not the Speedway – a practice that was allowed at the time. The structure was partially anchored to a pick-up truck, and situated in the infield of turn three. Over the years, the private scaffold platforms had become a popular fixture at the Speedway, with often many located around the massive infield. They were not sponsored by the track, and at times, the track management would attempt to curtail the practice, with safety in mind. However, enforcement was inconsistent, and they were not banned outright prior to 1960.
During the parade lap as the field drove by, the people on the platform began to lean and wave at the cars, which caused the scaffolding to become unstable. It soon tipped forward and fell to the ground, crushing people who were underneath the structure, and the 125–130 people who were on it either fell or jumped to the ground. Linder and Craig were pronounced dead of broken necks, and over 80 were injured, about 22 seriously.
After the accident, the Speedway banned "bootleg" homemade scaffolds at the track, a rule that still exists to this day. The track management was scrutinized by the state fire marshal and other officials for allowing the scaffolds to be constructed without permits, inspections, or any sort of safety rules. Other reports even criticized spectators who witnessed the tragedy and did little to offer help, whereas many in attendance were totally unaware of the accident. Johnny Rutherford, who was attending the race for the first time as a spectator, claims to have witnessed the accident.[14] In addition, his future wife Betty Hoyer, a student nurse, attended to the scene.[15]

The scaffold collapse was captured in a prize-winning series of images by Indianapolis News photographer J. Parke Randall

Background[edit]
The Indianapolis 500 was included in the FIA World Championship of Drivers from 1950 through 1960. The race was sanctioned by AAA through 1955, and then by USAC beginning in 1956. At the time the new world championship was announced and first organized by the CSI, the United States did not yet have a Grand Prix. Indianapolis Motor Speedway vice president and general manager Theodore E. "Pop" Meyers lobbied that the Indianapolis 500 be selected as the race to represent the country and to pay points towards the world championship.[16][17]
Drivers competing at the Indianapolis 500 in 1950 through 1960 were credited with participation in and earned points towards the World Championship of Drivers.[18] However, the machines competing at Indianapolis were not necessarily run to Formula One specifications and regulations.[19] The drivers also earned separate points (on a different scale) towards the respective AAA or USAC national championships. No points, however, were awarded by the FIA towards the World Constructors' Championship.

Summary[edit]
The 1960 Indianapolis 500 was round 3 of 10 on the 1960 World Championship. The event, however, failed to attract interest from any of the regular competitors on the Grand Prix circuit, particularly since it was held the day after the Monaco Grand Prix. Race winner Jim Rathmann earned 8 points towards the World Championship. Despite not competing in any of the other World Championship events, he finished eighth in the final season standings. This would be the final time the Indianapolis 500 paid points towards the World Championship of Drivers.
